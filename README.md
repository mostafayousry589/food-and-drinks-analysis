The Restaurant Revenue and Total Orders Analysis project presents a comprehensive examination of revenue streams and order patterns within a restaurant, employing advanced data visualization techniques in Power BI. This analysis delves into sales data, providing insights into revenue generation, popular menu items, peak ordering times, and customer spending behavior.
